## Agent Providers

`agent.provider` selects which AI coding agent the worker shells out to. Valid values are `claude` (Anthropic Claude Code, default) and `opencode` ([OpenCode](https://opencode.ai)).

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| `agent.provider` | string | `claude` | `claude` or `opencode` |
| `agent.binary` | string | `claude` for the `claude` provider, `opencode` for the `opencode` provider | Path to the agent CLI binary. Empty falls back to the provider default and resolves via `PATH`. |
| `agent.model` | string | `""` (provider default) | Model override. For `opencode`, use the provider/model form, e.g. `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4` or `openai/gpt-5`. |
| `agent.max_turns` | int | `0` (agent default) | Maximum agentic turns in headless mode. **Ignored by the `opencode` provider** — OpenCode's `run` subcommand has no max-turns flag. |
| `agent.exec` | string | `local` | `local` runs the agent on your machine (requires the agent CLI installed locally). `docker` runs `herd plan` inside `ghcr.io/herd-os/herd-runner-base`, which already carries all agent CLIs — no local agent install needed beyond Docker + the herd binary. See [Local vs Docker Agent Execution](#local-vs-docker-agent-execution). |
| `agent.exec_image` | string | `ghcr.io/herd-os/herd-runner-base:<herd-version>` | Override the image used by `exec: docker`. Empty defaults to the version-pinned base image (falls back to `:latest` on dev builds). |

### Example: OpenCode

```yaml
agent:
  provider: "opencode"
  binary: ""                       # defaults to "opencode"
  model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4"
  max_turns: 0                     # ignored by opencode
```

The runner environment must have an API key for whichever provider the model resolves to (default, recommended) — e.g. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for `anthropic/...` models, `OPENAI_API_KEY` for `openai/...` models. Alternatively, for `openai/...` models, ChatGPT subscription auth (opt-in, via a community plugin) is available by setting the `OPENCODE_AUTH_JSON` env var to a base64-encoded OpenCode `auth.json`. For `anthropic/...` models, an opt-in Anthropic subscription path exists via `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` plus the community-maintained `opencode-claude-auth` bridge plugin — the same OAuth token the `claude` provider uses. API key is the default; the subscription paths are opt-in. See [runners.md](runners.md#2-agent-authentication) for the authentication setup.

> `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` serves **both** the `claude` provider (Pro/Max subscription auth) **and** the `opencode` provider's opt-in Anthropic subscription bridge (`anthropic/...` models, via `opencode-claude-auth`). The bridge is only registered when the token is set, so the OpenCode API-key path is unaffected when it is absent.

## Local vs Docker Agent Execution

`agent.exec` controls where `herd plan` runs the coding agent. The default is `local`: the agent runs directly on your machine. Power users who already have the agent CLIs installed prefer this — there is no container overhead.

Setting `agent.exec: docker` runs `herd plan` inside the published runner image (`ghcr.io/herd-os/herd-runner-base`). herd mounts your current repo at `/work` inside the container and runs the same agent toolchain the workers use, so you need zero local agent install beyond Docker + the herd binary.

```yaml
agent:
  provider: "claude"
  exec: "docker"                   # run `herd plan` inside the runner image
  exec_image: ""                   # optional: override the default base image
```

### Override precedence

For one-off runs you can override the configured value. Precedence, highest first:

```
--exec local|docker  (flag)  >  HERD_EXEC env  >  agent.exec config  >  local (default)
```

### Recursion guard

When herd runs inside the container it sets `HERD_INSIDE_CONTAINER=1` and forces `local` execution for that process. This means a mounted `.herdos.yml` that says `exec: docker` cannot cause infinite docker-in-docker recursion — the inner herd always runs the agent locally inside the container. A single warning is logged when the guard fires.

### Behavior under `exec: docker`

- **First-run image pull**: the first run pulls the multi-minute base image (Docker caches it afterward). herd prints a one-line `Pulling …` hint before the pull so you know what is happening.
- **File ownership**: herd runs the container with `--user $(id -u):$(id -g)`, so files the agent creates in your worktree are owned by you, not root.
- **gh auth**: if `~/.config/gh` exists it is mounted read-only, so the in-container herd can call the GitHub API with your existing `gh` credentials.
- **`$EDITOR` caveat**: if the agent shells out to `$EDITOR` (e.g. Claude Code for some prompts), that editor runs **inside** the container, which does not carry your host editor. Avoid editor-dependent flows under `exec: docker`, or use `exec: local` for those.

## Review Strictness

Controls how aggressively the agent reviewer flags issues:

| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `standard` (default) | Flags bugs, security issues, missing error handling. Ignores style preferences. |
| `strict` | Also flags style issues, missing edge cases, code quality improvements. |
| `lenient` | Only flags critical bugs and security vulnerabilities. |

Findings are classified by severity:
- **HIGH**: Bugs, security vulnerabilities, race conditions, missing critical error handling — triggers fix workers
- **MEDIUM**: Missing edge cases, suboptimal error handling — triggers fix workers
- **LOW**: Style preferences, naming suggestions — informational only

HIGH and MEDIUM severity findings create fix issues and dispatch workers. LOW findings are listed in the PR comment for reference.

## Agent Review

The review agent runs in a strict output mode. It is instructed not to take any actions — no tool calls, no `gh`/`git`/`bash` invocations, no issue or comment creation, no file edits. Its only output is a single JSON object describing findings. Any mention of `.herd/integrator.md` or extra review instructions is appended to that contract; it does not loosen it.

If the agent returns unparseable output (e.g., the JSON cannot be decoded, or the output is empty/error-like), the integrator retries once after a 5-second delay within the same invocation. If both attempts fail, the integrator posts the following comment on the batch PR and sets the review aside without creating fix workers:

```
⚠️ **HerdOS Integrator** — Agent review failed to produce valid output after 2 attempts. Run `/herd review` manually to retry.
```

When you see that comment, run `/herd review` (optionally with a focus area) on the batch PR to trigger a fresh review. The integrator does not silently drop the review or auto-approve the PR.

## CI Fix Loop

`integrator.require_ci` enables CI failure detection on the batch branch, and `integrator.ci_max_fix_cycles` caps how many CI-failure fix cycles the Integrator will dispatch (0 = unlimited).

CheckCI pauses dispatching a new CI fix worker if any fix-type worker — review fix, CI fix, or conflict resolution — is still in progress in the same batch milestone. The next `workflow_run` trigger (when that worker completes) re-runs CheckCI, which then proceeds with dispatch if CI is still failing. This prevents the Integrator from creating overlapping fix workers that would race on the same batch branch.

## Worker Extra Env

`workers.extra_env` is a list of GitHub Actions secret names to surface as environment variables in the worker workflow's `Execute task` step, in addition to the built-in AI provider keys.

| Field | Type | Default |
|-------|------|---------|
| `workers.extra_env` | `[]string` (list of GitHub Actions secret names) | `[]` |

Each entry must be the exact name of a GitHub Actions repository or organization secret. herd does **not** create the secret — you must add it under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** before referencing it here.

```yaml
workers:
  max_concurrent: 3
  runner_label: herd-worker
  timeout_minutes: 30
  extra_env:
    - BUNDLE_RUBYGEMS__PKG__GITHUB__COM
    - NPM_TOKEN
```

For each name, the rendered worker workflow gets one line in the `env:` block of the form:

```yaml
BUNDLE_RUBYGEMS__PKG__GITHUB__COM: ${{ secrets.BUNDLE_RUBYGEMS__PKG__GITHUB__COM }}
```

The value comes from the GitHub Actions secret of the same name at workflow runtime.

This passthrough applies only to the worker workflow. The integrator and monitor workflows are not affected.

The workflow file is generated by `herd init`, so re-run `herd init` after editing `extra_env` to regenerate `.github/workflows/herd-worker.yml` with the new entries.

## Managing Configuration

```bash
herd config list                              # show all settings
herd config get workers.max_concurrent        # get a specific value
herd config set workers.max_concurrent 5      # set a value
herd config edit                              # open in $EDITOR
```

## Environment Variable Overrides

| Variable | Overrides |
|----------|-----------|
| `HERD_MAX_WORKERS` | `workers.max_concurrent` |
| `HERD_RUNNER_LABEL` | `workers.runner_label` |
| `HERD_MODEL` | `agent.model` |
| `HERD_TIMEOUT` | `workers.timeout_minutes` |
| `HERD_REVIEW_STRICTNESS` | `integrator.review_strictness` |
| `HERD_EXEC` | `agent.exec` (one-off; the `--exec` flag still wins) |

Environment variables take precedence over `.herdos.yml`.
