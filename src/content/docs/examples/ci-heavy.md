# CI-Heavy Configuration

HerdOS configuration for CI-intensive projects with extended timeouts, aggressive monitoring, and multiple fix cycles.

```yaml
# HerdOS configuration for projects with extensive CI pipelines.
#
# Higher fix-cycle limits let the integrator iterate on CI failures
# and review feedback without human intervention. Longer timeouts
# accommodate complex build and test suites.
